**QuizIA ‚Äì Reinventing Learning with AI**

At QuizIA, we are transforming the way students interact with knowledge. Our platform leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (**LLMs**) to create an intelligent, adaptive learning experience.

We are not just building a quiz app, but a personalized AI tutor that measures, challenges, and accelerates learning.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Vite, Node.js
- **Backend:** Go
- **AI Integration:** Anthropic LLMs, open-source models fine-tuned with Ollama

**Why invest in QuizIA?**
- Riding the wave of AI-powered edtech innovation
- Strong focus on measurable learning outcomes
- Dual strategy with proprietary and open-source AI integration
- Scalable, modern tech stack with low latency and high adaptability
